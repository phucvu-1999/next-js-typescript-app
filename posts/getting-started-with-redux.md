# Importance of State Management in JavaScript

State Management helps in updating the UI in related places when there is a change in the application data due to action performed in the application like click, hover, etc. It also helps in making sure that state changes have been incorporated at corresponding places.

## Redux, A Predictable State Container for JS Apps

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark. Since mid 2016, the primary maintainers are Mark Erikson and Tim Dorr.

## Predictable

Redux helps you write applications that **behave consistently**, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are **easy to test**.

## Centralized

Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like **undo/redo, state persistence**, and much more.

## Debuggable

The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace **when, where, why, and how your application's state changed**. Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use **"time-travel debugging"**, and even send complete error reports to a server.

## Flexible

Redux works with **any UI layer**, and has **a large ecosystem of addons** to fit your needs.
